# Authority Dashboard MVP - 4 Phase Development Plan

## Overview
**Timeline**: 8 weeks total (2 weeks per phase)  
**Scope**: Basic MVP without authentication system  
**Goal**: Real-time monitoring, incident management, and user-level tracking system for authorities

---

## Phase 1: Real-time Monitoring and User Search  
**Duration**: Weeks 1–2  
**Goal**: Build the foundation for real-time monitoring with search and map integration

### Key Tasks
- Set up project environment, database, and map integration  
- Design database schema for tourists, locations, and safety zones  
- Implement real-time location tracking for tourists  
- Add search functionality to look up tourists by name or digital ID  
- Display tourist locations on an interactive map  
- Provide real-time updates of tourist positions  
- Show high-level statistics and basic safety zone visualization

### Deliverables
- Real-time map with tourist locations  
- Search by name or digital ID  
- Live monitoring of tourist movements  
- Safety zone overlays on map  
- Basic dashboard layout with navigation

---

## Phase 2: Incident Management System  
**Duration**: Weeks 3–4  
**Goal**: Enable reporting, managing, and resolving incidents

### Key Tasks
- Build incident creation and tracking system  
- Add categories for incidents (medical, security, lost, emergency)  
- Enable evidence uploads such as photos, videos, or documents  
- Provide communication tools for real-time chat around incidents  
- Implement digital reporting with documentation and signatures (E-FIR)  
- Set up workflows for incident assignment, escalation, and resolution  
- Provide notifications and response coordination tools

### Deliverables
- Full incident reporting and management system  
- Evidence collection and secure storage  
- Real-time communication for incident handling  
- Digital FIR system  
- Resolution workflows with audit trail

## Phase 3: Tourist Registry and User Detail Pages  
**Duration**: Weeks 5–6  
**Goal**: Expand tourist registry and allow detailed tracking of individuals

### Key Tasks
- Build a searchable tourist registry  
- Create dedicated user detail pages (`/user/[id]`) showing:
  - Full profile information (identity, nationality, emergency contacts, KYC details)  
  - Current and past locations  
  - Activity history (location updates, incidents, communications)  
- Enable scanning of digital IDs for quick lookup  
- Provide communication options for individual or group messaging  
- Add emergency broadcast capabilities

### Deliverables
- Tourist registry with search and filtering  
- User detail pages with complete profile and history  
- Activity timeline and real-time location on map for individuals  
- Tourist communication and broadcast tools

---

## Phase 4: Analytics and Reporting System  
**Duration**: Weeks 7–8  
**Goal**: Provide advanced analytics, reporting, and optimization features

### Key Tasks
- Create analytics dashboards for incidents, tourist flows, and safety trends  
- Implement risk assessment and predictive analytics for unusual behavior patterns  
- Provide custom reporting with charts, exports, and scheduling options  
- Add performance monitoring and system health tracking  
- Optimize system performance and scalability  
- Prepare production deployment with backup and recovery measures

### Deliverables
- Advanced analytics dashboards  
- Custom and scheduled reporting system  
- Risk assessment and predictive insights  
- System monitoring and optimization tools  
- Production-ready deployment

---

## Success Metrics
- **Phase 1**: Map loads within 3 seconds, search returns results in <2 seconds  
- **Phase 2**: Incident creation under 2 minutes, real-time chat latency <1 second  
- **Phase 3**: User detail pages load in <3 seconds, activity timeline updates in real-time  
- **Phase 4**: Analytics dashboard loads within 5 seconds, reports generated in <30 seconds

---

## Risk Mitigation
- Optimize real-time data handling with throttling and clustering  
- Use indexing and optimized queries for database performance  
- Add reconnection logic and offline handling for real-time failures  
- Define strict scope for MVP to avoid scope creep  
- Continuous testing, staging environment, and incremental demos before deployment

---

## Quick Implementation Note (optional)
If a rapid prototype is needed (e.g., demo in a few hours), focus scope on:
- Search → Map → User detail flow only  
- Use seeded test data and minimal styling  
- Defer incident workflows, advanced analytics, and exports to later phases
